			<p class="text-big">Express yourself through poetry</p>
			<p class="text-small">Poetry is a type of literature based on the interplay of words and rhythm. It often employs rhyme and meter (a set of rules governing the number and arrangement of syllables in each line). In poetry, words are strung together to form sounds, images, and ideas that might be too complex or abstract to describe directly.</p>

	<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The experiment we call Words of Wise began in May 2009, what now seems a lifetime ago. I wanted an uncluttered, peaceful space to read and share poetry, so I started building one in my time after work. The site now serves over a million readers a month and is a home to hundreds of thousands sharing their poetry. HePo remains a labour of love, however the cost and time to run the site has increased considerably. If you like this place and wish to keep our community alive and well, please consider supporting in the following ways. Thank you!

	<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Poetry helps us make sense of the world. At weddings we read poetry to celebrate, at funerals it helps us to grieve. Tony Walsh’s This is the Place and Ben Okri’s poem Grenfell Tower, June, 2017 are recent examples of how poetry can help us to unpack, process, and communicate even, and perhaps especially, in the most challenging situations. Poetry is about human connection. It’s people listening to each other, sharing their stories, conveying important messages. It’s vital and innate and has always provided a powerful format for protest. Apples and Snakes started in the 1980s; we’ve seen how artistic expression not only reflects but also shapes the events of the day. We’ve worked with artists including Benjamin Zephaniah, Kate Tempest, Lemn Sissay – artists who both clarify and complicate the world with words.</p></div>

	<p class="sectionTag text-big">Increasing popularity of poems</p>
	<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">At a key moment in our history – when we are more technologically networked than ever and yet feel increasingly isolated – poetry provides a lens through which we can view the world anew, discover, explore, and understand, it provides a space in which we can connect to ourselves and to one another. For us, poetry has never been elite. We’ve been challenging the expectations of what poetry is for over 35 years. It is protest. It is dialogue. It is confrontation and it is empathy. It isn’t escapism,  it isn’t inaccessible. And it isn’t confined to the page. We have staged performances at picket-lines, on buses, in supermarkets, gardens, swimming pools, in theatres; we have made work in schools, prisons, libraries. And we are only just scratching the surface of where poetry can go and who it speaks to. We were keen to get their take on the statement: No Word Unspoken. We asked some of the brilliant artists we’ve collaborated with in recent times to respond with voice recordings, videos and written phrases. This page showcases their responses.</p></div>
